# Handyscripts
Handy POSIX(mostly) scripts I made for personal use.
###  Clone to /usr/local/bin and add to PATH. Set executable bit with chmod +x if necessary. These should work on most POSIX systems. I try to minimize dependency on sucky software like that made by the FSF/GNU. If these script are not suckless, or do not work with any POSIX compatible system, please let me know, also, if you make changes, I'd be grateful if you made a PR.
